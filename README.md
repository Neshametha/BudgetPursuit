# BudgetPursuit
Gamify your finances!

Eating out too much? Seeing too many movies? Here is a fun and easy way to stay on top of your cash. You set a monthly budget based on different categories (Groceries, Restaurants, Travel, etc.) to try and keep your little pixel swordsman alive.

If you go over budget, you take damage - the more overbudgeting, the more damage you take. If you save a little extra money for the month, you heal or get extra life. If your life depletes all the way, your character will die and you will have to start all over!

## Technologies Used
* ReactJS
* NCR Open API

## Scaling
The plan is to add the ability for your character to complete "quests" with information on financing - such as how to balance a checkbook, how credit works, how stocks work, etc. The idea is to truly gameify financing so it is more accessible.
